Description             : This is a GENMIDI patch for DMX for OPL2/3 FM
                          synthesis. This patch aims to remedy the "weak"
                          default instruments to better match the Roland
                          Sound Canvas, most notably the SC-55 and SC-88.
                          Recommended minimum setup for no note-cuts is 
                          ZDoom 2.8.1 with DOSBOX OPL3 emulator core, 
                          with 6 chips emulated. See the README for
                          additional details.

* Construction *

Base                    : Stock DMX GENMIDI
Build Time              : About 5 years
Editor(s) used          : Hex Editors, OPL3 Bank Editor, Fraggle's Python
                          scripts, Adlib Tracker II, Edlib, ADLMidi
Known Bugs              : Due to the number of pseudo 4-op voices, certain 
                          notes may cut sooner than they would have using 
                          the stock patches. Most of Doom and Doom 2 play 
                          just fine. Depending on your CPU, there may be
                          skips in the sound due to buffer underrun, as 
                          this patch takes more channels than the stock
                          GENMIDI.
May Not Run With        : Recent dev builds of GZDoom have broken OPL3
                          support as of this writing.
Tested With             : ZDoom 2.8.1, Chocolate Doom, Vanilla Doom, ADLMidi
