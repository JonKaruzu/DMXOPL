# DMXOPL
New and improved DMX GENMIDI for Doom and sourceports.

*(I'm assuming you know what this is, so why even bother with a text file?)*

## What?
Okay, so a lot of people hated the DMX sound banks, mostly the percussion - it sounds "correct" if you're doing orchestral scores, but doom is not just that - it's thrash! Enter this OPL patch that aims to make OPL synth better for source ports on platforms that don't have the best MIDI access.

## Will this run on Vanilla?
Yes, but some note cut-offs will happen if you don't have your **DMXOPTION** variables set. Even then, this may cut notes. I was aiming for sound quality with source ports that can run multiple OPL2/OPL3 chips, but I may release a cut-down version later.

## YOU MISSED (X) SOUND!
This isn't done yet. Of course I missed some. Most are still DMX defaults. I've only redone a few select sounds that I've always hated in the original set. Some I liked, so I have kept.

## What IWAD works best?
Doom Registered. That's what I used to test these patches on. Doom 2 is being started (rock organ has been redone entirely) so expect D_STALKS to sound pretty good soon.

## HOW CAN I HELP
I unno, send a pull request I guess?
